//When you run the program, it will greet you with the message "Hi Mudith" (or any other custom greeting you prefer).
//You will then have the option to enter a message of your choice.
//After you enter your message, the program will reply with "Hi Mudith" again.
//The program will keep responding with "Hi Mudith" unless you type "hi" (without quotes) as your response.
//If you type anything other than "hi," the program will continue saying "Hi Mudith."
//The program will end when you type "hi" as your response.
